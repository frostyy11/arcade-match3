In Godot Editor, click on `Scene → New Scene → 2D Scene`

This creates a Node2D as the root

With the Node2D selected, click the "Attach Script" button (it looks like a page with a + sign, in the toolbar at the top of the Scene panel)

In the Attach Node Script dialog:

You'll see "Path: res://node_2d.gd" (or similar)

Change it to something like: res://match3.gd

Click "Create"

Delete the template code that appears (the extends Node2D and _ready() function)

Copy and paste all of my code from the artifact above

Press Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac) to save

Press F5 to run the game!
